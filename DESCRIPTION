Title: Tools for Robust Decision Making analyses for CRC models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Pedro Nascimento de Lima
Maintainer: Pedro Nascimento de Lima <plima@rand.org>
Description: This package implements the crcmodel and the crcexperiment R6
    classes and can be used to perform Robust Decision Making Analyses of
    multiple models.  The package supports common tasks, such as defining
    and conducting Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses (PSAs) with one or
    multiple models. The package is also designed to allow for
    High-Performance Computing workflows using EMEWS using the EMEWS
    EQ/SQL to allow efficient use of High-Performance computing resources
    for large-scale, long-running experiments.
