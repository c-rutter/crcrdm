Title: Tools for Robust Decision Making analyses for CRC models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Pedro Nascimento de Lima
Maintainer: Pedro Nascimento de Lima <plima@rand.org>
Description: This package implements the CRCmodel and the CRCexperiment
    classes and can be used to perform Robust Decision Making Analyses of
    multiple models.  The package supports common tasks, such as defining
    and conducting Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses (PSAs) with one or
    multiple models.  The package is integrated with EMEWS EQ/SQL to allow
    efficient use of High-Performance computing resources for large-scale,
    long-running (e.g. 10^5 - 10^9 CPU hours) experiments.
