## Installation

This package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {.r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("c-rutter/crcrdm")
```

## Usage

There are two main classes implemented in this package: `crcmodel` and `crcexperiment`.

A crcmodel object can represent any colorectal cancer model with a natural history component and a screening component. `crcspin` is **a** `crcmodel`.

The `crcmodel` object exists so we can create a `crcexperiment` the `crcexperiment` can include one or more models and implements functions that help us create experimental designs with multiple models.


## Requirements for this package

This package is being created with Rapid Response funds from the CRC CISNET group, and will support two aims:

1.  **Incorporate the SSP pathway into the CRC-SPIN model**, and **calibrate the CRC-SPIN model under a wide range of SSP assumptions.**
2.  **Characterize the robustness of a set of CRC screening strategies** to those assumptions.

The `crcrdm` R package will support both aims. The functions contained in this package could be included in scripts in a one-off R project, but we envision that this work will be useful to other projects as well, which is why we chose to create code that can be reused across analyses.

Initially, the package will be compatible with the `crcspin` model and the `imabc` package. However, we will build this package in a way that could allow other modeling groups to use it with their CRC models. At a later stage, the functions created in this package could be re-used to other purposes as well.

This package builds from [our prior work with COVID-19](https://github.com/RANDCorporation/covid-19-reopening-california) and is inspired by other RDM-related packages such as [Rhodium](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Rhodium) and the [EMA Workbench](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html). However, most of the features of those packages are not helpful for CRC models for several reasons. In CRC and health outcome models, much of the process of addressing uncertainties lies in how models are specified and calibrated, and these concerns are not addressed by those packages.

With that in mind, this package will need to:

1.  **Accomodate multiple models or multiple versions of the same model:** The questions we pose could require us to build multi-model analyses. We might have to compare the baseline specification of a model to new specifications (e.g., accounting for the SSP pathway). Using this package shouldn't be harder than running multiple regressions with different functional forms.

2.  **Be EMEWS-compatible by design:** This package needs to be compatible with EMEWS, so we can use Argonne's HPC systems efficiently. This is not too hard, but important design decisions need to be made and enforced such that there is a clear separation between specifying the model, specifying a calibration exercise, running the calibration exercise, then collecting results. We should be able to run any computation-intensive task in three modes, which roughly correspond to three phases of model development and use:

    1.  **Running it Locally - sequentially (for testing and debugging):** During the first stages of model development, modelers are debugging their models and inspecting them in detail. Once the model is verified and "seems to be working", they go to the next phase.

    2.  **Running it in small servers or locally - in parallel**: This scale (e.g. \< 100 h of CPU time) is more appropriate for small, proof-of-concept or sanity check runs. For example, modelers should do this before going big to test edge cases.

    3.  **HPC runs with EMEWS (\> 100 CPU hours):** These are useful to perform the actual, "production runs".

    These three modes are important and making it easy to navigate between them is crucial, especially with iterative approaches like RDM. This should allow modelers to do their modeling work, then to scale it with HPC systems as they become confident in the model - rather than having them trying to calibrate broken models in HPC systems because our setup was to inflexible to allow the appropriate process.

3.  **Efficiently handle long-running tasks:** Actual production runs can take days or weeks to complete, even with HPC resources. Our current approaches for dealing with this involve manual control of runs. We would like to have a better-designed process for these long-running tasks, and this package can accommodate that by intelligently setting calibration hyperparameters such that calibration or policy run tasks are divided and contained within wall-time limits set in Argonne's servers. Similarly, experiment runs should be randomized in a way that allows preliminary inspection of results. For policy experiments, we should be able to slowly draw tradeoff curves when we have only 10% of the design run. This helps us to fail fast rather than waiting long runs to complete only to discover that something was wrong.

## Key objects: `crcmodel`, and `crcexperiment`

To the purposes of the RDM analysis, we envision two key classes:

1.  `crcmodel` : Is the basic unit and encompasses a single model structure. A `crcmodel` can be either calibrated or not. if it is calibrated, the model object can include the posterior distribution of its parameters.
2.  `crcexperiment` : Contains the definition of an experiment experiment to be applied over the crcmodels included in it.


## Original Timeline

We will complete the basic structure of this R package (iterations 1 and 2) over the summer of 2021. By the end of this summer, we should be able to complete each step in the analysis with a preliminary SSP model.

-   Iteration 1 -- Aug 21- Setting up the analytic pipeline -- existing model and screening policies

    -   Deliverable: Code to reproduce iteration 1

-   Iteration 2 --Sept 21- First SSP model specification and sparse experimental design

    -   Deliverables: Model write-up, illustrative scenario results -- should reveal if edge cases are policy-relevant.

-   Iteration 3 -- Nov 21  - CISNET Annual Meeting - Revised SSP model, granular experimental design

    -   Deliverables: Paper Intro and Method sections, illustrative scenario results

-   Iteration 4 -- Jan 22 -- Final SSP model, granular experimental design finished

    -   Deliverables: First paper draft finished, illustrative scenario results

-   Iteration 5 -- April 22 -- CISNET Mid-year meeting 

    -   Deliverables: Presentation for Mid-year meeting, Paper draft revised.

-   Iteration 6 -- June 22 -- Paper write-up

    -   Deliverables: Paper draft submitted.
