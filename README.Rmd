This package implements the `crcmodel` and the `crcexperiment` R6 classes and can be used to perform Robust Decision Making Analyses of multiple cancer screening models using High-Performance Computing resources. The package supports common tasks, such as defining and conducting Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses (PSAs) with one or multiple models. The package is also designed to support High-Performance Computing workflows using EMEWS using the EMEWS EQ/SQL backend. This feature will allow efficient use of High-Performance computing resources for large-scale, long-running experiments that involve simulating a large population over thousands of simulation runs.

## Installation

This package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {.r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("c-rutter/crcrdm")
```

## Status

This package is under development, and will be used in Robust Decision Making analyses that use cancer screening models.

This repository **does not** contain code for the models used within those analyses, and is made public primarily to allow for automatic installation across HPC systems and to support continuous integration workflows in repositories that depend on this package. You should not use or rely on this package unless you are involved in these development efforts.

## Package Design and Requirements

This package builds from [our prior work with COVID-19](https://github.com/RANDCorporation/covid-19-reopening-california) and is inspired by other RDM-related packages such as [Rhodium](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Rhodium) and the [EMA Workbench](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html). However, most of the features of those packages are not helpful for CRC models (or health microsimulation models) for several reasons. In CRC and health outcome models, much of the process of addressing uncertainties lies in how models are specified and calibrated, and these concerns are not addressed by those packages.

With that in mind, this package will need to:

1.  **Accommodate multiple models or multiple versions of the same model:** The questions we pose could require us to build multi-model analyses. We might have to compare the baseline specification of a model to new specifications (e.g., accounting for the SSP pathway). Using this package shouldn't be harder than running multiple regressions with different functional forms.

2.  **Be EMEWS-compatible by design:** This package needs to be compatible with EMEWS, so we can use Argonne's HPC systems efficiently. This is not too hard, but important design decisions need to be made and enforced such that there is a clear separation between specifying the model, specifying a calibration exercise, running the calibration exercise, then collecting results. We should be able to run any computation-intensive task in three modes, which roughly correspond to three phases of model development and use:

    1.  **Running it Locally - sequentially (for testing and debugging):** During the first stages of model development, modelers are debugging their models and inspecting them in detail. Once the model is verified and "seems to be working", they go to the next phase.

    2.  **Running it in small servers or locally - in parallel**: This scale (e.g. \< 100 h of CPU time) is more appropriate for small, proof-of-concept or sanity check runs. For example, modelers should do this before going big to test edge cases.

    3.  **HPC runs with EMEWS (\> 100 CPU hours):** These are useful to perform the actual, "production runs".

    These three modes are important and making it easy to navigate between them is crucial, especially with iterative approaches like RDM. This should allow modelers to do their modeling work, then to scale it with HPC systems as they become confident in the model - rather than having them trying to calibrate broken models in HPC systems because our setup was to inflexible to allow the appropriate process.

3.  **Efficiently handle long-running tasks:** Actual production runs can take days or weeks to complete, even with HPC resources. Our current approaches for dealing with this involve manual control of runs. We would like to have a better-designed process for these long-running tasks, and this package can accommodate that by intelligently setting simulation hyperparameters such that policy run tasks are divided and contained within wall-time limits and memory limits set in Argonne's servers. Similarly, experiment runs should be randomized in a way that allows preliminary inspection of results. For policy experiments, we should be able to slowly draw tradeoff curves when we have only 10% of the design run. This helps us to fail fast rather than waiting long runs to complete only to discover that something was wrong.

## Key classes: `crcmodel`, and `crcexperiment`:

To the purposes of the RDM analysis, we envision two key classes:

1.  `crcmodel` : Is the basic unit and encompasses a single model structure. A `crcmodel` can be either calibrated or not. if it is calibrated, the model object can include the posterior distribution of its parameters. A single model may contain multiple posterior distributions when those parameter sets were created by different calibration runs, with potentially different targets or priors.
2.  `crcexperiment` : Contains the definition of an experiment experiment to be applied over the `crcmodel`s included in it.
