# crcrdm 1.0.0

* First stable version of the package.
* Implements the `crcmodel` and `crcexperiment` classes.
* `crcmodel` can be used to represent a cancer screening model with a natural history component and a screening component.
* `crcexperiment` can be used to create experimental designs with multiple models, each with multiple parameters distributions.
* `crcexperiment` also supports population blocks, which can be used to divide simulation runs in population sizes at the HPC side.
* `crcexperiment` also supports pre-defined grid experimental designs.

# crcrdm 0.1.0
